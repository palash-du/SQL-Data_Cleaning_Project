# Data Cleaning Using SQL: World Life Expectancy

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the World Life Expectancy data cleaning project. This project focuses on applying SQL techniques to clean a dataset sourced from Analyst Builder, aimed at improving the data quality for subsequent analysis. By addressing common data issues such as duplicates and missing values, we ensure the dataset is reliable and ready for in-depth analysis.

## Dataset Overview

Within this repository, you will find two key datasets:

- **Raw Data**: The original dataset containing a comprehensive set of life expectancy indicators across different countries and time frames. This dataset serves as the baseline for our cleaning process.

- **Clean Data**: The result of our data cleaning efforts. This dataset has been refined to remove inaccuracies and inconsistencies, providing a solid foundation for analysis.

## SQL Data Cleaning Highlights

The data cleaning process employed a variety of SQL functions and clauses, including:

- **Deleting Duplicates**:
  - `COUNT()`
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`
  - `PARTITION BY`
  - `ORDER BY`

- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - `UPDATE`
  - `SET`
  - `JOIN`
  - `ROUND()`
  - `WHERE`

These SQL tools were essential in identifying and correcting issues within the dataset, improving its integrity and usefulness.

## Getting Started

To apply these data cleaning methods, ensure your SQL environment is set up and can execute queries. Import the 'Raw Data' into your database, then run the provided SQL scripts to perform the cleaning operations.
